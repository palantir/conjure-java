fix:
  description: The java classes for conjure enums are now annotated with `@com.google.errorprone.annotations.Immutable`,
    which ensures that if they're used inside hand-rolled enums, Google's [ImmutableEnumChecker](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ImmutableEnumChecker)
    won't complain.
