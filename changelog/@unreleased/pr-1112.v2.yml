improvement:
  description: The `conjure-java` CLI is now published as a jar so that it can be invoked in process by custom gradle plugins. Note that gradle-conjure does not use this approach to ensure that classpaths remain isolated and that the conjure-java generator can be upgraded independently from the gradle-conjure plugin itself.
