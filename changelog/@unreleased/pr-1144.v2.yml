  description: Support conjure tags in place of cumbersome java annotation-based markers.
    The `safe` and `unsafe` tags are supported by the Jersey generator. The Undertow
    generator passe through the simpler value to the underlying ParamMarker which
    has internally been updated to support `safe` in addition to `com.palantir.logsafe.Safe`.
    The undertow `Async` annotation can be replaced by the `server-async` tag.
