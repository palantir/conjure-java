    Generated equals uses memoizedHashCode if available

    When we generate a memoizedHashCode field for a conjure object, the
    equals & equalTo implementation now compare memoizedHashCode for objects
    being compared, and will short circuit and return false if both objects
    have already computed their hashCode and they do not match.

    This is beneficial for complex conjure types that may be used as keys in
    hash based collections, including graphs that rely on both hashCode and
    equals.
