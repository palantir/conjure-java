feature:
  description: conjure-undertow supports an additional `ServerRequestContext` parameter
    providing access to arbitrary request headers and query parameters. This feature is
    enabled on an opt-in basis by adding the `server-request-context` tag to an endpoint.
    Note that this is still considered an experimental feature.
