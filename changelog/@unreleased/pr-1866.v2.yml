  description: |-
    Modern JDKs (anything >= JDK9) use the newer version of this annotation
    to represent Generated types. This change does force a minimum JRE
    dependency of Conjure to JRE9 or later at compile time (this annotation
    only has source retention).

    Annotation processors are able to get away with detecting the JDK
    and generating code specfic to that JDK, I don't believe we can
    do that with Java Poet, so this is potentially a more invasive change
    than I'd traditionally like to make.

    One option is to add an option to the Options type to opt out of this
    behavior, or we can just force Java 9+.
